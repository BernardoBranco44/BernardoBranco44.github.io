        Hello! My name is Bernardo Branco, I'm located in Portugal and I love
        coding, especially in the web development world. My interest started
        through a friend who said that I'd probably enjoy it, and as expected,
        he was right.

        I started learning frontend on my own and it quickly became my
        day-to-day, soon after that I enrolled in and completed Le Wagon's
        fullstack bootcamp. It opened my eyes to the fullstack world and I love
        every part of it. Now I try to improve on the things I already know and
        keep learning new ones.

          <li>React</li>
          <li>Node.js</li>
          <li>Express.js</li>
        </ul>
